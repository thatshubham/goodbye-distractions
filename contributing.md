### Updating your Pull Request

Sometimes, a maintainer will ask you to edit your Pull Request before it is included. This is normally due to spelling errors. [Here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) is a write up on how to change a Pull Request, and the different ways you can do that.
